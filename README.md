## Introduction

This program was created to assist with 2 of the routine procedures needed for the mapping project. 

The first procedure is for converting the crime data found [here](http://data.vancouver.ca/datacatalogue/crime-data-details.htm). For this routine, we would download the Crime (XLSX) file. This XLSX file contains the needed data for all years, but uses UTM coordinates for the events. We need to convert this data into a tab delimited TXT file with Latitude and Longitude coordinates before we can use it for our mapping software. This program automates the process of converting the coordinates and changing the file format. Coordinate conversion functions used for this program were based on [this](https://github.com/Berico-Technologies/Geo-Coordinate-Conversion-Java). 

The second procedure was to combine weekly patrol reports emailed in CSV format into monthly reports. This program lets you drag and drop all the CSV files needing to be combined and combines them into one file automatically. 

Note: I have heard that sometimes the third party software responsible for emailing the CSV files might generate some invalid data in cetain columns, and we hav ebeen manually correcting them. Please feel free to let me know of those issues with details on where the values are and where they are supposed to be, etc, and I can add a function to automatically correct them as well.
